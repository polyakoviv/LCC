 annote = {Due to the polymer plasticizing ability and ionic nature of ionic liquids (bistrifluoromethanesulfonimidate salts of 1butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium and dodecylethyidiphenylphosphonium, BDMIm Tf2N and DEDPP Tf2N, respectively), they were found to be excellent compounds for preparing ion-selective membrane electrodes. Membrane polymers studied were poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(vinyl chloride). The electrodes demonstrated good and extremely stable response to both cations and anions (including surfactants) and were successfully applied to the analysis of detergents.},
