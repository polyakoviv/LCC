 annote = {Intel Optane  technology is a  cost-effective solution to  create large non-volatile memory pools, which is attractive to many  scientific  applications.  Last  year  Intel  Optane  DC Persistent Memory in DIMM (PMM) form-factor was introduced, which  is  capable  of  being  used  as  main  memory  device.  This technology  promises  faster  memory  access  comparing  to  Intel Optane DC P4800X SSD with IntelÂ® Memory Drive Technology devices available previously.

In  this  paper,  we  present  new  benchmark  data  for  the  Intel Optane  DC  Persistent  Memory.  We  studied  the  performance  of scientific  application  from  domains  of  quantum  chemistry  and computational  astrophysics.  To  put  performance  of  the  Intel Optane   DC   PMM   in   comparison,   we   used   two   memory configurations: DDR4 only system and Optane DC SSD with Intel Memory  Drive  Technology  (IMDT)  that  is  another  option  for memory  extension.  We  see  that  PMM  is  superior  to  IMDT  in almost  all  our benchmarks, to  no surprise.  However,  PMM was 20-30%  more  performant  in  quantum  chemistry  and  only marginally  better  for  astrophysics  simulations.  We  also  found, that for  practical calculations  hybrid setup  demonstrates  on  the same order of magnitude performance as DDR4 system.},
