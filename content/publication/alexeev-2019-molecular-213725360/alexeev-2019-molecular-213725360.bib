 abstract = {A solvent screening model for the molecular electrostatic potential is developed for the fragment molecular orbital combined with the polarizable continuum model at the Hartree-Fock and density functional levels. The accuracy of the generated potentials is established in comparison to calculations without fragmentation. Solvent effects upon the molecular electrostatic potential and density are discussed. The method is applied to two proteins: chignolin (PDB: 1UAO) and ovine prostaglandin H(2) synthase-1 (1EQG).},
