 abstract = {Power consumption is a major concern for modern and future supercomputers. To cut energy consumption down, innovation is needed for applications, system software, and hardware. One of the first steps is the measurement and analysis of energy consumption of popular applications. In this paper, we will analyze the performance of a popular quantum chemistry (QC) method called Hartree-Fock (HF), which has massive storage requirements for electron repulsion integrals (ERIs). The total power to solution has important contribution from the CPU energy consumption as well as from the computer's storage device (SSD or HDD).},
