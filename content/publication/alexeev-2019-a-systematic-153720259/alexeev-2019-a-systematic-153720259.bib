 abstract = {The alanine dipeptide is a standard system to model dihedral angles in proteins. It is shown that obtaining the Ramachandran plot accurately is a hard problem because of many local minima; depending on the details of geometry optimizations, different Ramachandran plots can be obtained. To locate all energy minima, starting from geometries from MD simulations, 250,000 geometry optimizations were performed at the level of RHF/6‐31G*, followed by re‐optimizations of the located 827 minima at the level of MP2/6–311++G**, yielding 30 unique minima, most of which were not previously reported in literature. Both in vacuo and solvated structures are discussed. The minima are systematically categorized based on four backbone dihedral angles. The Gibbs energies are evaluated and the structural factors determining the relative stabilities of conformers are discussed.},
