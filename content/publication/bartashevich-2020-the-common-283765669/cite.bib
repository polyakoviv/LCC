 annote = {We disclose the common trends for relationships between the binding energy and the local electronic properties at the bondcritical points of electron density for the halogen, chalcogen, and pnictogen bonds in molecular complexes. Variations in thesorting principles for noncovalent bonds in which the electrophilic site delivered by the P, As, S, Se, Cl, Br atoms are studied.Electronic kinetic and potential energy densities give regularly changing parameters in the single-factor models \flqqbindingenergy versus local electronic property\frqq only if a sort of electrophilic site provider is fixed. In contrast, the electrostaticpotential and the potential acting on an electron in a molecule lead to the common trends only if the nucleophilic moleculeis fixed. The behavior of parameters in the single-factor models was also studied under the different sorting principles ofnoncovalent bonds in samples.},
