 abstract = {The fragment molecular orbital method in GAMESS is parallelized in a multithreaded OpenMP implementation combined with the MPI version of the two‐level generalized distributed data interface. The energy and analytic gradient in gas phase and the polarizable continuum model of solvation are parallelized in this hybrid three‐level scheme, achieving a large memory footprint reduction and a high parallel efficiency on Intel Xeon Phi processors. The parallel efficiency is demonstrated on the Stampede2 and Theta supercomputers using up to 2048 nodes (262 144 threads).},
