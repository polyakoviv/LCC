{{% callout note %}}
Specialized student group of Computer Modeling in Chemistry (the group #13) is supervised by the LQCMM.
{{% /callout %}}
In addition to the general academic program of the faculty, students of the group attend advanced courses on mathematical methods in chemistry, numerical methods and programming.
Many general subjects (such as calculus, linear algebra, programming, quantum physics and some others) are taught separately from the regular learning track.
